# Magento Media Gallery

Currently there is no way to easily access Magento's media storage UI without having to go to CMS > Pages or CMS > Static Blocks :thumbsdown: With this module you will be able to have access to the Media Gallery from anywhere with a navigation item on the main admin panel navigation.

## Soon to come

- [ ] Ability to upload more than just images (PDF, docx, csv, etc)
- [ ] Possibly an ajax option that load loads the media gallery on any page without leave your current page
